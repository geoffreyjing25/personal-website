        <p className='text-md text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300'>I'm Geoffrey Jing, an incoming junior at Carleton College studying 
            CS + Stats, and broadly interested in entrepreneurship, product management, venture capital, and software engineering. 
            Last summer, I interned at an EdTech B2B SaaS startup, <a href="https://www.village.com/" target="_blank" className='text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300
            text-indigo-500 dark:text-indigo-500'>Village</a>, where I wore multiple hats on the engineering team as 
            a full stack software engineer and enjoyed challenging myself in a fast-paced, stimulating environment. I also helped build 
            a website and gained exposure to training machine learning models for an AI healthcare startup later that year.</p>
            <p className='text-md text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300'>
            This fall, I spent an amazing semester studying CS
            abroad in Budapest, Hungary, and got to explore Europe! (Here's a photo of me in front of the Big Ben in London!)
            This winter term, I worked part-time as a product manager and software engineer intern at Transiport, a supply chain management and global logistics startup.
            While at college, I lead VCarl, Carleton's first and premier VC organization, as well as serving
            as the VP of my school's robotics team. While I'm not studying or working, you can find me at collegiate golf tournaments as a starter 
            for our NCAA Division III Men's Golf team.
            I absolutely love meeting new people, so don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
